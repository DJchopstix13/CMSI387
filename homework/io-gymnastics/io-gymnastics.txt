# JD: For your screen exercise, I generally see what you did but you could
#     have chosen better screenshots.  For example, how do I know what you
#     did when you first launched screen?  How do I know what progress your
#     program made?  At least you could have modified your recursiveFib program
#     to produce some output, so it is clear that it was doing some work while
#     you were away.
#
#     At any rate, I still do think you did this successfully; just didn't
#     document it very well.

# JD: For finding the directory taking up the most space, you did hit upon
#     the right *initial* command (du -d 1 -h) but observe that you still have
#     to scan the result to get the directory that uses the most room.  Here is
#     another case where you have not taken automation to its full potential.
#     You need a few more commands to (a) make it super easy to locate the
#     directory that takes the most space and (b) filter the results so that
#     you only get that information and no extras.  Between the two, (a) is
#     more important than (b).  It wouldn't have been so bad if you did (a)
#     but not (b).  However, you did neither.

# JD: For the mounted devices, you did get an appropriate command (diskutil),
#     but just note that this command is Mac OS X-specific.  mount and df are
#     the more platform-independent Unix equivalents.
