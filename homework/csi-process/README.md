Use long-running invocations (i.e., huge numbers) of the `thread-java` and/or `thread-posix` sample programs to do the following on at least two operating systems chosen from Linux, Mac OS X, and Microsoft Windows. The chosen two can be different for each task, depending on what is possible or easy for each operating system:

1. Invoke the long-running program, send it to the background, and run another program that produces output.Take a screenshot of that big hot terminal mess.

2. Invoke the long-running program, and use a process monitor on the operating system platform to see that programâ€™s threads. How do the different operating systems represent the threads? Note any major similarities and differences, accompanied by screenshot evidence.
