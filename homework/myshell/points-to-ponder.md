Points To Ponder:
=================

1. Why did the cd command get special mention in 
this assignment? 

    The `cd` command got special mention because `cd` is not an executable command.  

2. Can your shell run scripts? Why or why not? 

    My shell does not run scripts because it only knows how to handle certain executable 
    commands (e.g. `ls`, `ping`).

3. Does Ctrl-D exit your shell? Why or why not? 
    
    Ctrl-D` exits my shell because the while loop keeps going until an `EOF`
	character is found.
