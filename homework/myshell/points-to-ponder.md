Points To Ponder:
=================

1. Why did the cd command get special mention in 
this assignment? 

    The `cd` command got special mention because `cd` is not an executable command.  

> JD: That is true on some operating systems, but not all.  Case in point: Mac OS X has */usr/bin/cd*.
>     The expected answer is a *universal* issue with `cd`.

2. Can your shell run scripts? Why or why not? 

    My shell can run scripts.  It can even run the interactive shells that are built into my kernel.  

> JD: This needs more detail.  How do you get your shell to run a script?  And no,
>     running a script by running *another* shell does not count.

3. Does Ctrl-D exit your shell? Why or why not? 
    
    `Ctrl-D` exits my shell because the do-while loop keeps going until an `EOF`
	character is found.

> JD: Yep, this is right.
