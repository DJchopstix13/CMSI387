Points To Ponder:
=================

1. Why did the cd command get special mention in 
this assignment? 

    The `cd` command got special mention because `cd` is not an executable command.  

2. Can your shell run scripts? Why or why not? 

    My shell can run scripts.  It can even run the interactive shells that are built into my kernel.  

3. Does Ctrl-D exit your shell? Why or why not? 
    
    Ctrl-D` exits my shell because the do-while loop keeps going until an `EOF`
	character is found.
