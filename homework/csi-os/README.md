> JD: Your Mac shots are generally OK except for the kernel.  You list a bunch of kernel *modules*, which do extend the functionality of the kernel, but they are not the kernel itself.  Also, you display some networking information, but you used `netstat`, which is different from the `ip` information that your Windows shot displayed.  There is a more direct equivalent to `ip` available.

- Linux (aka Ubuntu)

> JD: Your Linux shots are generally in the right direction except for the kernel.  You point out a bunch of configuration settings, but not the actual code that acts on those settings.  Your networking screenshot also uses `netstat` here, but there is a closer equivalent to `ip` in Windows.
