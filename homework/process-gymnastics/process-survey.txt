# Updates to Process Gymnastics:

# JP: Dondi, I fixed #3 and 4... see the new images

# Feedback on Original 2/06 Assignment:
# JD: For #3, you used top, which has an interactive element that circumvents
#     what we were getting at with these command exercises.  If you use top,
#     you have to hit the right keys every time.  Therefore using top is not
#     automatable or scriptable.  You do not get the answer you want right away.
#     This is not the same as "making the computer do as much work as possible."


# JD: For #4, you used ps -d, where -d, according to the man page, selects all
#     processes except for "session leaders."  What's a "session leader?"  Are
#     you sure that is the same as "all users except root and yourself?"
