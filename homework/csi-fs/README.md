#CSI-FS

###From Dr. Dionisio's (aka Dondi) assignment page:

"The final task for the semester is a classic digital forensics exercise: reading a disk at the hex level. The work has been virtually spelled out for you step by step. Just follow along, then read the bytes."

The folder structure goes as follows:

    diskimage/     # Where we create sample files to read at the hex level
    
    hexdump.txt    # The result from running `hexdump -C image`
    
    image          # Self-explanatory, but it is the disk that we can mount/unmount
    
    output.txt     # The Terminal Output I ran on my Ubuntu VirtualBox
